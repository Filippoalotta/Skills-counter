# JavaScript Counter 💻

This is a simple JavaScript counter project. It allows users to increase and decrease the counter value and save it to `localStorage`.
I created this counter so you can rate your Front-End Development skills and share them.

## Instructions 📋

1. **Increment and Decrement the Counter**: Click the "Increase" and "Decrease" buttons to increase and decrease the counter value.

2. **Save the Counter**: By clicking "Save," you can store the current counter value in `localStorage`.

## How It Works 🔧

- The counter value is stored in `localStorage` when you click "Save."

- `localStorage` is domain-specific and keeps data available across browser sessions.
